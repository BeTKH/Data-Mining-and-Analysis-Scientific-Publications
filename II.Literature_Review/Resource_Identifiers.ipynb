    "# 2. Literature Review of Resource Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers are very common in our day-to-day life. Just like we have personal identification documents, like a passport, city registration ID, driving license, university ID, etc..., in the digital world as well we have digital identifiers that are used to identify or trace objects in an unambiguous way. As long as these identifiers remain valid, the objects they refer to can be identifiable and traceable over a period of time [[33]](http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl/?dariah-2014-1).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of digital identifier can be evaluated in terms of persistence and uniqueness. Persistent and unique identifiers provide a reference to a research resource unambiguously even if the original file location is changed. Usually, these identifiers are machine-actionable, they can be used directly on a web browser, to resolve to the resource object they refer to [[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persistent_identifier&oldid=1000109890). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some identifiers are used to identify a specific type of object only. For example, ISBN is used to identify a book but not a video. A video on YouTube, for instance, can be identified by its YouTube ID. On the other hand, there are general-purpose identifiers, like Archival Resource Keys (ARKs), which can be used to identify almost everything [[20]](https://n2t.net/e/ark_ids.html) [[36]](https://plumanalytics.com/identifiers-types-research-output/). \n",

    "### 2.1. Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n",
    "\n",
    "A URI is used on the web to uniquely identify various types of resources. A URI is used to identify almost everything: objects, people, places, information resources such as books, web pages, etc. URIs that are used to locate resource objects on the internet are known as Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Another variant of URI is Uniform Resource Name (URN) which provides a unique naming service to identify a research resource on the web  [[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uniform_Resource_Identifier&oldid=1005623423) [[16]](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h53jtszs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A given URI not necessarily have to be categorized as a URI or a URL. Instances of URIs can have characteristics of a URL or a URN or even both. Therefore a URI can refer to a resource location, a resource name, or both. Usually, a URI has to be recalled by people, thus its sequence of characters should be meaningful rather than arbitrary [[14]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).\n",
    "\n",
    "A URN is a persistent and location-independent resource identifier that is oftentimes easy to integrate into other resource identification schemes [[34]](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8141). Some URNs create a unique name to resource objects purely based on the URI schema definition, whereas other URNs create a unique name based on other non-URN identifier systems like ISBNs, ISSNs, or RFCs [[34]](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8141). "

A PURL is basically a redirection service that redirects the PURL links to the current location of the resource on the internet. The concept of PURL is generic and can refer to any system that provides a re-direction service [[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persistent_uniform_resource_locator&oldid=1005330951). \n",

The resolver maps the PURL to the actual resource URL and returns it to the client.
